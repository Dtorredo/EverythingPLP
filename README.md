## 📝 Overview  

Why create **two separate portfolios** when you can merge them into **one seamless experience**?  

This project is my submission for the **July 2025 PLP Africa Hackathon** — a **unique dual-portfolio website** that showcases the profiles of both me and my deskie:  
**🎩 Derrick** _(dark theme)_ & **🌸 Jackie** _(light theme)_.  

Switch between our portfolios effortlessly with a **cool, interactive theme toggle**.
