## PLP Africa July 2025 Cohort Hackathon - Dual Portfolio

No need to make two distinct portfolios for us, just click the toggle and view my partner's work!
This project is my submission for the July 2025 PLP Africa Hackathon. <br>
It is a unique, dual-portfolio website showcasing the profiles of me and my deskie, Derrick and Jackie, within a cool, interactive page <br>

### ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Portfolios**: A single website housing two complete, individual portfolios.
- **Creative Theme/Content Toggle**: A prominent toggle switch allows users to seamlessly transition between my dark-themed portfolio and Jackie's light-themed portfolio.
- **Pure CSS Interactivity**: The theme and content switching is accomplished entirely with HTML and CSS, using a checkbox input and sibling combinators for a 
cool dark/light mode without using Js.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Distinct Sections**: Each portfolio includes sections for:
    - About Me
    - Hobbies
    - Work Experience
    - Projects
    - Contact Me
